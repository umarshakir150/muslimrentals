# Decisions

A durable log of significant decisions made about this project. Add a new
entry per decision — do not edit past entries except to fix factual errors
in how a decision is recorded (never to relitigate it retroactively; open a
new entry for that instead).

Only decisions with actual repository evidence or an explicit founder
statement belong here. Do not backfill invented history for decisions that
predate this log — the entries below start from when this AI operating
system was introduced.

## 2026-08-25 — Adopt a repo-native supervisor/worker AI operating structure

Decision: Introduce `CLAUDE.md`, `agents/`, `company/`, and `ai/` as the
standing structure for coordinating AI-assisted work on this project,
before any concurrent/automated orchestration is built.

Reason: The founder wants persistent, specialized roles (Supervisor,
Engineering, Frontend, Backend, QA, Security, Designer, Trust & Safety,
Legal, Support) with clear approval gates and durable task records, instead
of ad hoc single-agent sessions with no memory or review structure. Building
a full concurrent-orchestration platform first would be premature — the
repo-native structure needs to be validated in practice first.

Alternatives considered: (a) build an external orchestration service or
multi-process Claude harness immediately — rejected as premature per the
founder's explicit instruction; (b) keep working ad hoc with a single
`CLAUDE.md` and no role separation — rejected because it doesn't support
independent review gates (QA/Security/T&S/Legal) or delegation.

Impact: All future non-trivial work should go through
`ai/workflow.md`'s pipeline and use `ai/tasks/TEMPLATE.md`. No application
code was changed to introduce this — it is documentation-only.

Revisit when: The repo-native workflow has been exercised on a handful of
real tasks and the founder wants to evaluate moving to actual concurrent
Claude processes per `ai/orchestration-plan.md`.
